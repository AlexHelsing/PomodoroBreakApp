Simple pomodoro break app made in python for macOS. Download the zip and unzip it to try it yourself :)

## What is it?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. (From wiki).

## Technologies used

Python developed in PyCharm using tkinter library for GUI.

## Why?

To try out the pomodoro break technique! Created it with the help of an online bootcamp/course around 1-2 years ago when starting to code.
